Compiled from libsvm 2.83.

The file libsvm.dll was compiled on Windows 2000 and I'd expect it to
work on XP but it fails to load. For this reason libsvm-xp.dll is also
provided that was compiled on XP. Unfortunately I see no way to
distuinguish between Windows 2000 and XP easily so it's up to the user
to arrange for the right file to get loaded for instance by copying
libsvm-xp.dll it over libsvm.dll.
